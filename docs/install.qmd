## Gen TSO Installation

You can install `Gen TSO` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/gen_tso/) with the following command:

```bash
pip install gen_tso
```

## Pandeia Engine Installation

To use `pandeia` you would need to download some files as per their [documentation](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PEN/Pandeia+Engine+Installation).

### Reference data

First you need to download the pandeia reference data (version 3.0) from
this folder: [https://stsci.app.box.com/v/pandeia-refdata-v3p0-jwst](https://stsci.app.box.com/v/pandeia-refdata-v3p0-jwst)

Unpack the file and set the `$pandeia_refdata` environment variable pointing
to the top folder of the data (the directory containing the VERSION_PSF file).

### Stellar atlases

Then, you need to download these three reference stellar and calibration files, for example with these commands:

```bash
wget https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsps/reference-atlases/hlsp_reference-atlases_hst_multi_kurucz-1993-atlas_multi_v2_synphot4.tar
wget https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsps/reference-atlases/hlsp_reference-atlases_hst_multi_pheonix-models_multi_v3_synphot5.tar
wget https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsps/reference-atlases/hlsp_reference-atlases_hst_multi_everything_multi_v15_sed.tar
```

Unpack these files and set the environment variable: `$PYSYN_CDBS` pointing to
the trds directory.

### Vega reference SED

Lastly, you need to download the Vega reference spectrum:

```bash
wget https://ssb.stsci.edu/trds/calspec/alpha_lyr_stis_010.fits
```

and place the file in your `$PYSYN_CDBS` trds/calspec/ folder.
