## 1 Gen TSO Installation

You can install `Gen TSO` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/gen_tso/) with the following command:

```bash
pip install gen_tso
```

## 2 Pandeia Engine

To use `pandeia` you need to download some files as per their [documentation](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PEN/Pandeia+Engine+Installation).

### 2.1 Reference data

If you don't have it yet, download the latest pandeia reference data,
unzip it, and place it in the folder pointed by `$pandeia_refdata`.
Here's the current latest version:
[https://stsci.app.box.com/v/pandeia-refdata-v4p0-jwst](https://stsci.app.box.com/v/pandeia-refdata-v4p0-jwst)

If this is your first time using pandeia, you likely need to setup a
`$pandeia_refdata` environment variable (e.g., in your `~/.bashrc`,
`~/.bash_profile`, or whichever bash file your machine uses).

Then you will need to start a new prompt terminal or source your bash
file, e.g.:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```


You should end up with something like this:

```bash
echo $pandeia_refdata
/home/USERNAME/data/pandeia_data-4.0-jwst
```

### 2.2 Atlases data

Pandeia also needs some stellar and throughput files to simulate exoplanet spectra.  Use one of the options below to stay up to date:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## With TSO

Use this prompt command to automatically check and upload the required atlases

```bash
tso --update_db
```

## Manually

If this is your first time using pandeia, you likely need to setup a synphot
`$PYSYN_CDBS` environment variable (e.g., in your `~/.bashrc` file) pointing
to the trds directory (see below).

Then, download these reference files (e.g., with the wget command below) and
place them inside the folder pointed by `$PYSYN_CDBS` (make sure to keep the
`trds/...` folder structure of the downloaded files):

```bash
wget https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsps/reference-atlases/hlsp_reference-atlases_hst_multi_kurucz-1993-atlas_multi_v2_synphot4.tar
wget https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsps/reference-atlases/hlsp_reference-atlases_hst_multi_pheonix-models_multi_v3_synphot5.tar
wget https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsps/reference-atlases/hlsp_reference-atlases_hst_multi_everything_multi_v15_sed.tar
```

Lastly, download the Vega reference spectrum
and place the file in your `$PYSYN_CDBS` trds/calspec/ folder.

```bash
wget https://ssb.stsci.edu/trds/calspec/alpha_lyr_stis_010.fits
```

If everything went right, then you should see something similar to this:

```bash
# (remember to source your bash file or start a new prompt terminal)
echo $PYSYN_CDBS
/home/USERNAME/data/pysynphot/trds

ls $PYSYN_CDBS
calspec  comp  grid  mtab
```

## 3 NASA Exoplanet Archive (optional)

`Gen TSO` is updated regularly to ensure that the exoplanet database remains
mostly up to date.  But if you want to update the planet data up to the
current date, you can run this prompt command:


```bash
tso --update_exo
```

## Live status check

While you are running the `Gen TSO` application, click on this gear icon
at the top right of the screen:

This will pop up a more detailed panel indicating whether any database needs
to be updated (and if needed, it will give you the instructions to do so):
