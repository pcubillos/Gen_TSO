Lets use `Gen TSO` to show all successful existing JWST transit programs:

1. parsed by host
2. filter by transit event
3. excluding failed runs

```{python}

import gen_tso.catalogs as cat

catalog = cat.Catalog()
host = ''
info = {}
nplanets = len(catalog.targets)
for target in catalog.targets:
    has_transits = (
        target.is_jwst and
        target.is_transiting and
        'transit' in target.trexo_data['event']
    )

    if has_transits:
        obs = target.trexo_data
        programs = obs['program']
        events = obs['event']
        status = obs['status']
        mode = obs['mode']
        nobs = len(events)
        info[target.host] = [
            f"    {programs[i]:24}  {mode[i]:20}  {status[i]}"
            for i in range(nobs)
            if events[i] == 'transit'
            if status[i] not in ['Skipped', 'Failed', 'Withdrawn']
        ]

for key, observations in info.items():
    print(f'\n{key}:')
    for obs in observations:
        print(obs)
```
