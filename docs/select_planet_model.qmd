## Uploading model files


Users can upload a planetary depth model through the TSO application
by clicking the *upload* button in the lower section of the **Target**
panel:

This will prompt an upload panel where users can browse for their
models.

Transit or eclipse models are plain-text files with two columns specifying
the wavelength in the first column (in microns) and the eclipse or transit
depth in the second column.  The transit/eclipse depth can have no units,
be in percent units, or in ppm units.  Be sure to set the right units
when uploading to match those of your file.

Here's an example of a [transit model](https://github.com/pcubillos/gen_tso/blob/master/gen_tso/data/models/WASP80b_transit.dat) for WASP-80 b, which looks like this:

```default
# Wavelength        (Rp/Rs)**2
#         um          unitless
     0.65000   2.925465860e-02
     0.65043   2.924718769e-02
     0.65087   2.924386021e-02
     0.65130   2.925036286e-02
     0.65174   2.925147078e-02
     0.65217   2.924379653e-02
     0.65261   2.924312047e-02
     0.65304   2.924513224e-02
     0.65348   2.924248270e-02
...
```

## Pre-loading models at launch

If you plan to work with multiple models or make many simulation over
and over, it's more convenient to pre-load them when launching the TSO
application.  Users can do this by indicating a folder from where to
look for models when initializing the application from the prompt, e.g.:

```bash
tso path_to_model_files
```

A convenient technique is to `cd` into the folder where one has the models
and then start the application with:

```bash
tso .
```

Transit models in the selected folder will be identified as such if they
contain *'transit'* or *'transmission'* in their names, or if they are in a
sub-folder named *'transit'*.

Similarly, eclipse models in the selected folder will be identified as
such if they contain *'eclipse'* or *'emission'* in their names, or if they
are in a sub-folder named *'eclipse'*.


::: {.callout-note}
When pre-loading planetary models, the depth units of the files must
always be 'none'

## Basic models for quick assessment

If you only want to make a quick S/N assessment before investing more
time for a given target, it's possible to use flat transit-depth models
or blackbody eclipse-depth models.  For each of these, the user can
adjust the basic model properties.

When selecting either of these models, default values for Rp/Rs and
temperatures are taken from the planet system parameters.

## Interactive visualization

For any user-input or basic planet models, by clicking the bookmark
button (earth), the viewer panel on the right will display them:

The viewer panel will show all bookmarked models, and overlay the bandpass
of the current instrumental setting, facilitating comparison between
models

Clicking on the gear icon opens a little menu with some options
to adjust the display:
