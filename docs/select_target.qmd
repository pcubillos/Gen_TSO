## Select target

The **Target** panel lets the user select the science target from a
dropdown menu of known target (from the NASA Exoplanet Archive).  An
auto-complete feature facilitates searching for specific targets.

The gear icon lets users filter what kind of target to search:

By selecting a target, the fields with the physical properties needed
to simulate an observation will be automatically updated.  The values
in these fields can be edited if desired.  The various information
links help to make an informed decision (see below).

### Info-links

For any given target, info-links on top of the name will provide
additional information about the target.

The first link (blue) shows any relevant name alias for the target:

When clicked, `Gen TSO` will display the system parameters extracted
from the NASA Archive.
The second link (black) will open the NASA Archive page for the current
target.

The third link indicates whether the *host* has JWST observing
programs (gold color) or not (gray).  For targets with JWST
programs one can click on the link to display a summary of the
programs (data from the
[Trexolists](https://www.stsci.edu/~nnikolov/TrExoLiSTS/JWST/trexolists.html)
website).  Color coding indicates whether the program was carried out,
is in proprietary period, or is still to be observed.

Lastly, unconfirmed candidate targets have an additional icon
highlighting that:

## Stellar properties

The main stellar values to set for a simulation are the magnitude and
stellar energy distribution (SED).

`Gen TSO` provides the Ks magnitude value for the targets.  Users can
choose among the J, H, Ks, Gaia, and V bands; although these values
rarely need to be edited since these magnitudes are well established:

The stellar effective temperature and log(g) values mainly inform the
user on the optimal SED to choose.  `Gen TSO` provides a set of
PHOENIX, Kurucz, and Blackbody models.

By clicking the bookmark (star) icon, users can display and compare
the SEDs on the right viewer panel.  The instrumental observing band
will be highlighted in light-blue indicating the wavelength range of
the SED(s) being probed.

Users can also provide their own custom SED models by clicking the
*upload* icon, which will pop up the following panel:

## Observation configuration

Users can choose between transit and eclipse observation modes.
