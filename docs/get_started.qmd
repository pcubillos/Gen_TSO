With `Gen TSO` you can produce JWST simulated spectra in as few as four simple steps.

## 1 Select target

A drop down menu lets you search/type for confirmed planets and TESS candidates
(data provided by the NASA Exoplanet Archive).  Once a target is selected:

- [Editable fileds](select_target.qmd) are automatically filled with the system properties
- A link provides the target's name aliases full system properties
- A link leads you to the NASA Exoplanet Archive
- A link displays the exisiting JWST programs on the host star

## 2 Set instrument and mode

The top menu lets you select the JWST instrument and mode:

- All TSO spectroscopic and acquisition modes are available
- The detector setup panel gets automatically updated for the current instrument
- The right interactive viewer shows the available filter throughputs of the instrument

## 3 Set transit/eclipse model

The transit or eclipse depth spectrum encodes the core of a science case,
so this is the one bit of information that a user has to provide.
In the `Gen TSO` application users can:

- Search and [upload transit/eclipse depth spectra#uploading-model-files](select_planet_model.qmd)
- [Pre-load spectra](select_planet_model.qmd#pre-loading-models-at-launch) when launching the application
- Use blackbody or flat-transmission spectra for a quick S/N assessment
- Interactively view and compare spectra in the viewer panel

## 4 Run Pandeia

Now you are ready to simulate a TSO with JWST.  `Gen TSO` provides many
features to facilitate this step as well:

- The text display shows exposure and saturation values in real time
- Estimate saturation for an SED and instrument combination
- Automate number of integrations, matching a given observation duration

Once a simulation has ran:

- The text display summarizes it as in the official ETC
- The TSO tab shows interactive displays of the transit/eclipse depth, S/N, and more
- The warnings tab alerts users of potential risks
- Runs can be saved to a pickle file for later use

## Bonus: Target Acquisition

Here's one my favorite features.  While `Gen TSO` offers acquisition on a
science target, sometimes the target is just too bright.  For such cases you can:

- Search for Gaia stellar sources around the science target
- Use the `ESASky` viewer to guide and select a nearby target
- Run the acquisition on the nearby target
