With `Gen TSO` you can produce JWST simulated spectra in as few as four simple steps.

## 1 Select target

A drop down menu lets you search/type for confirmed planets and TESS candidates
(data provided by the NASA Exoplanet Archive).  Once a target is selected:

- [Editable fileds](select_target.qmd) are automatically filled with the system properties
- A link provides the target's name aliases full system properties
- A link leads you to the NASA Exoplanet Archive
- A link displays the exisiting JWST programs on the host star

- All TSO spectroscopic and acquisition modes are available
- The detector setup panel gets automatically updated for the current instrument
- The right interactive viewer shows the available filter throughputs of the instrument
