### Gen TSO: A general TSO simulator for exoplanets with JWST

`Gen TSO` is a graphical interface to simulate JWST time-series
observations (TSO) of exoplanets.  Gen TSO connects together:

- The [JWST's Pandeia ETC engine](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PEN/Pandeia+Engine+News)
- The [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/)
- The [trexolists database](https://www.stsci.edu/~nnikolov/TrExoLiSTS/JWST/trexolists.html) of JWST TSO programs
- The [Gaia catalog](https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/) of stellar sources

Which combined, allow `Gen TSO` to offers an interactive interface to easily
visualize, assess, and compare the JWST characterization capabilities
for known exoplanets.

`Gen TSO` provides:

- Instant access to system parameters of known exoplanet targets
- Instant access to previous JWST programs of targets
- Interactive visualization of target's field of view with [ESASky](https://sky.esa.int/esasky/)
- Perform transit and eclipse S/N simulations for all JWST spectroscopic modes
- Perform target-acquisition simulations on science or nearby targets
- Interactive visualization of transit, eclipse, and stellar SEDs spectra, observing modes, and simulated TSO spectra

`Gen TSO` is a Python3.9+ package available via the PyPI repository:

```bash
pip install gen_tso
```

Then, you can launch the `Gen TSO` application with this prompt command:
```bash
tso
```
