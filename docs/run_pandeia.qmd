## Before running


### Observation duration

You may want to adjust the observation time in the *Observation* sub-panel
in the lower left.
The observation duration is automatically derived from the target's transit
duration according to the [JWST recommendation for TSOs](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-imager-and-slitless-spectrograph/niriss-example-science-programs/niriss-soss-time-series-observations-of-wasp-39/step-by-step-etc-guide-for-niriss-soss-time-series-observations-of-wasp-39):

$$T_{\rm dur} = T_{\rm start} + T_{\rm settling} + T_{\rm baseline} + T_{\rm transit} + T_{\rm baseline}$$

Where each term is:

- $T_{\rm start} = 1$ hour (the start timing window).
- $T_{\rm settling} = 0.75$ hour (settling time for telescope systematics).
- $T_{\rm transit}$ is the duration of the transit/eclipse
- $T_{\rm baseline}$ is the baseline time before and after transit/eclipse

The baseline time is calculated as

$$ T_{\rm baseline}  = \min(0.5 T_{\rm tran}, 1{\rm h})$$

Surely, users can directly set the observing time or adjust the
variables for this calculation by clicking the gear icon:

### Exposure times

While you are setting the target and instrumental configuration
the **Results** text display in the lower left shows you real-time exposure
and saturation values (i.e., values are instantly updated as you change
the configuration)

The exposure time shows you the length of the observation according
to the instrument setting in seconds (e.g., to assess the length of a
single integration):

![](images/exposure_single.png){height=150px}

And also in hours, to make sure the total TSO observing time is correct.
to simplify this step, click the *Match obs. duration* switch to
automatically adjust the integrations to match the *Obs_dur* time:

![](images/exposure_match.png){height=150px}


### Saturation

`Gen TSO` provides pre-calculated saturation times for all PHOENIX and
Kurucz SEDs (when calibrated in the Ks band) for most spectroscopic modes.
So, users will immediately know how many groups can be set before a given
saturation threshold.

For other cases (e.g., when providing a custom SED), click the button
next to *Groups per Integration* to calculate saturation level:

![](images/saturation_estimate.png){width=500px}

The *Results* panel will then show the max. fraction of saturation
(updated in real-time for the current setting), and the number of groups
that can be set before exceeding 80% and 100% of saturation at the
brightest pixel:

![](images/saturation_display.png){width=300px}


If you have dangerously high saturation levels, you will see
the warnings in the *Results* panel:

::: {layout-ncol=2}

![Over 80% saturation](images/saturation_warning.png){width=275px}

![Over 100% saturation](images/saturation_danger.png){width=275px}

:::


And if the observation cannot be carried out at all without saturating,
the panel will show the warnings:

## Running Pandeia

Once you are happy with the target and instrument configuration, just click
the golden **Run Pandeia** button.

::: {.callout-note}
Different instrument and modes have widely different processing times
in Pandeia; e.g., the NIRISS/SOSS and NIRCam/Short Wavelength modes will
take some more seconds than other modes.

### Figures

When finished, the *TSO* tab in the viewer panel will show the simulated
transit or eclipse depth spectrum:

![](images/run_pandeia_TSO.png){width=450px}

On this panel, click on the gear icon to open the plots menu
where you can select plotting options that will update the plot
in real-time:

- How many collected observations
- At which resolution sample the noised-up spectrum
- Wavelength and depth ranges and scales
- Draw a new realization of the noised-up spectrum

![](images/run_pandeia_menu.png){width=400px}

The first button in this menu also allows you to select and display 
additional plots:

- 1D flux rate spectra of the source (in and out of transit) an background
- 1D S/N of the flux spectra 
- 2D flux rates on the detector
- 2D S/N at each pixel on the detector
- 2D detector saturation mask
- 2D detector map of number of group before saturation

Here are some examples:

::: {layout-nrow=3}

![**1D flux rates** for WASP-80b with NIRSpec/G395H](images/run_pandeia_1D_flux_rates.png){width=500px}

![**1D S/N** ratios for WASP-80b with NIRSpec/G395H (note this is the S/N for the total integration time, whereas the plot above shows the flux rates per second)](images/run_pandeia_1D_snr.png){width=500px}

![**2D S/N** ratios for WASP-80b with NIRSpec/G395H](images/run_pandeia_2D_snr.png){width=500px}

:::

In case of any partial of full saturation, the 1D plots will hightlight the
affected wavelengths:

### Text outputs

When a TSO run has finished, the *Results* panel at the bottom will
display a summary of the run, similar to what you see in the ETC
(with some values broken down by in- and out-of-transit):

![](images/run_pandeia_results.png){width=450px}

The *Warnings* tab will indicate whether Pandeia raised any
warnings or not:

::: {layout-nrow=2}

![No warnings](images/run_pandeia_no_warnings.png){width=500px}

![Warnings are clearly highlighted](images/run_pandeia_warnings.png){width=500px}

:::


### Collecting outputs

All *Run Pandeia* calls will be collected in the *Display TSO run* menu
on the top right panel.  These runs will be sorted by transit, eclipse,
and aquisition run:

![](images/run_pandeia_display.png){width=550px}

When selecting a run frmo this menu, the target and instrument
configuration will be updated to that of the run.  Also, the plots in the
*TSO* tab and the results/warnings tabs below will be updated according
to the selected run.

The buttons to the right of the menu allow users to delete runs or
save them to Python pickle files for later use.  Clicking on the *Save TSO*
button will pop up the following panel where users can set the directory
and file name for the pickle file:
